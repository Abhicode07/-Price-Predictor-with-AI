## Features

- **Data Collection**:
  - Fetch historical price data from Binance API.
  - Preprocess and normalize data for AI models.

- **AI-Powered Prediction**:
  - Predict price movement trends (up/down) with confidence scores.
  - Implement algorithms like LSTM, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.

- **Backtesting Framework**:
  - Test predictions against historical data.
  - Calculate accuracy, profit/loss metrics.
  - Visualize model performance with plots.
